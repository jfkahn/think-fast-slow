# think-fast-slow
A project using galvanic skin response to teach the world about two modes of thinking. Created using netlogo and gogoboard.

## There are a number of components

### Netlogo
1. Intro Screen - this screen should welcome the user and tell him that he will learn that he has two modes of thinking!
2. Thinking Fast - This screen should prompt the user to anwer 1+1 or pick which color they like better, etc. Meanwhile we should record the value from the "GSR". We could play a sound or display a color based on the response.
3. Thinking Slow - The intention here is to get an increase in the GSR reading by prompting the user to solve a difficult problem and or by showing them an extreme video of a cow being slaughtered.
4. Review screen - thank them for experiencing it and show them graphs of how they responded.

### Physical Sesnor
1. Add elastic band to keep the senor on the thumb.
2. If time, design an apparatus to be able to insert the thumb, LEDS would be cool too.

*I found that the palm has the most active “sweat glands” so making it fit in the palm might be a good idea.*
